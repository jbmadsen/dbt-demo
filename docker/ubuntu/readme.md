# Ubuntu with all the bells and whistles 

This Ubuntu container has been specifically created for two purposes:

1) I didn't want to install anything on any of my computers for a demo project (no dbt, odbc driver, etc.)
2) I wanted a portable environment, where I can do work from any computer

There is no reason to use this container if you have everything in the Dockerfile properly installed on your own system.
