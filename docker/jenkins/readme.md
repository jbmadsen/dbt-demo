# Configuring Jenkins


## Setting up the Jenkins setup using Configuration-as-code

From this nice [DigitalOcean tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-automate-jenkins-setup-with-docker-and-jenkins-configuration-as-code) by [Daniel Li](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/users/d4nyll)!
Awesome stuff.

And [this one](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/JCasC) for adding a Job DSL code to the config.

Aaand, lets not forget [this annoying bug!](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46684972/jenkins-throws-java-lang-illegalargumentexception-invalid-refspec-refs-heads).

## Setting up a Jenkins Job using the Job DSL plugin, again all configured in code

From this nice [DigitalOcean tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-automate-jenkins-job-configuration-using-job-dsl), again by [Daniel Li](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/users/d4nyll)!
Awesome stuff.

As well as [this backup tutorial](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/Tutorial---Using-the-Jenkins-Job-DSL), and some [Job DSL documentation](https://jenkinsci.github.io/job-dsl-plugin/).


## Setting up the Pipeline-as-code [Jenkinsfile](./../../Jenkinsfile)

TODO: I need to figure out and remember the sources, decumentation, and tutorials I used there.
